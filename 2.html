<h2>CSS</h2>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank">For other uses, see Design</a> (disambiguation).<<strong> The person who produces a
      design</strong> is called a <u>designer</u>, <u>which</u> is a term generally
      used for people who work professionally

      <p> Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
      different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
      tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
      The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies
      if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
      The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
      text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
      In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain</p>
