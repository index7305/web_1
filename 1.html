       <h2>The designer 박준용</h2>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank">For other uses, see Design</a> (disambiguation).<<strong> The person who produces a
      design</strong> is called a <u>designer</u>, <u>which</u> is a term generally
      used for people who work professionally

      <P>The core element of a web page is one or more text files written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</p>
      .[1] Many web pages also make use of <strong>JavaScript code fordynamic behavior and Cascading Style Sheets</strong>
      <p style="margin-top:50px">(CSS) code for presentation semantics.[1] Images, videos, and other multimedia files are also often
      embedded in web pages.</P>
      <img src="coding.jpg" width="80%">
      <br><P>Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their
      browser, that page's elements are downloaded from web servers.
      The browser then transforms all of the elements into an interactive visual representation on the user's device.[2]
      If the user clicks or taps a link to another page, the browser repeats this process to display the new page, which
      could be part of the current website or a different one.</p>
