      <P>The core element of a web page is one or more text files written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</p>
      .[1] Many web pages also make use of <strong>JavaScript code fordynamic behavior and Cascading Style Sheets</strong>
      <p style="margin-top:50px">(CSS) code for presentation semantics.[1] Images, videos, and other multimedia files are also often
      embedded in web pages.</P>

      <br><P>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
         specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time coiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
         dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
         Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables
         interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side
         page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
