<h2>WEB</h2>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank">For other uses, see Design</a> (disambiguation).<<strong> The person who produces a
      design</strong> is called a <u>designer</u>, <u>which</u> is a term generally
      used for people who work professionally

      <P>The core element of a web page is one or more text files written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</p>
      .[1] Many web pages also make use of <strong>JavaScript code fordynamic behavior and Cascading Style Sheets</strong>
      <p style="margin-top:50px">(CSS) code for presentation semantics.[1] Images, videos, and other multimedia files are also often
      embedded in web pages.</P>

      <br><P>Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first
        implementation of what he called "literate programming": the idea that one could create software as works of literature,
        by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse
        (as is common practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers,
         rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.
        Web consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts,
        and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX..</p>
